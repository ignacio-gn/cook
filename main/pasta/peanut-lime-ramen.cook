Combine the @peanut butter{2%Tbsp}, @oyster{1%Tbsp}, @soy sauce{1%Tbsp}, @chili{some}, and @brown sugar{1%Tbsp} in a bowl until it forms a smooth paste.

Bring a #small pot{} of water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, take water{1/4%cup} and stir it into the peanut-chili paste until it forms a smooth, pourable sauce.

Add the @ramen{85%g} noodles (without seasoning packet) to the boiling water and boil for ~{2%min}, or just until the noodles are tender.

Drain the noodles, then return them to the pot with the heat turned off. Pour the peanut sauce over top and stir to combine. Top with sliced @green onion{}s and serve immediately.
