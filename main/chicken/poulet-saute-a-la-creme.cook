Follow the instructions of /main/chicken/poulet-saute with @chicken{500%g} (or the entire chicken). Place the chicken on a hot platter.

Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the casserole. Stir in the minced @shallots{1%tbsp} or green onions and cook slowly for 1 minute. Add @white wine{1/2%cup} and boil rapidly down to about 3 tablespoon, scraping up the coagulated juices. Add the @whipping cream{1%cup} and boil it down unitl it has thickened slightly.

Correct seasoning. Off heat and just before serving, swirl in @butter{1-2%tbsp} and minced @parsley{1-2%tbsp} or mixed green herbs.
