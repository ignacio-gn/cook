Pat the @salmon fillets{4} dry with paper towels. Season both sides with @salt and @black pepper{to taste}.

In a #large skillet{}, heat @olive oil{2%Tbsp} over medium-high heat. Place the salmon fillets in the skillet, skin-side down, and sear for about ~{3-4%min} until the skin is crispy.

In a bowl, whisk together @grappa{0.33%cup}, @maple syrup{0.25%cup}, @soy sauce{2%Tbsp} (low sodium), minced @garlic{2%cloves}, and grated fresh @ginger{1%tsp}.

Pour the grappa glaze over the seared salmon fillets. Continue cooking the salmon for an additional ~{4-5%min} or until it reaches your desired level of doneness, basting the salmon with the glaze occasionally.

Transfer the glazed salmon to a serving platter. Garnish with chopped @green onions{} and @sesame seeds{} if desired.
