In a #heavy-bottomed pot{}, dump @red wine{1/4 of the available stock}. Add peeled and chopped @shallots{a few} and begin reducing over high heat. When about half the wine has cooked away, add the @stock{}, bring to a near boil, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Avoid boiling, very important. 

Reduce until there is a lush, dark brown sauce. It should be thick, but not that much either. Fill containers and store in the freezer.

Note: This demi-glaze can be further reduced, but like this it's useful for every need.
