A souffle, quickly described, is a sauce containing a flavoring or purée into which stiffy beaten egg whites are incorporated. It is turned into a mold and baked in the oven until it puffs up and the top browns.

*EGG WHITES*
The glory and lightness of French souffles are largely a matter of how voluminously stiff the egg whites have been beaten and how nicely they have been incorporated into the souffle base. Both beating and folding are perfectly simple operations when you know the reasons behind the directions.

A fluffy mass of beaten egg whites is actually hundreds of minute air bubbles all connected and enclosed by a fflm of egg white; the bubbles of air expand as the souffle cooks in the oven, and that is what pushes it into its magniffcent puff. Whether you beat them by hand in a copper bowl in the time-honored way of the old chefs of France, or whether you use electricity, your egg whites should mount 7 or 8 times their original volume. They should be perfectly smooth and have a velvety sheen, and they should be ffrm enough to stand in peaks as in the illustration on the opposite page.

### Warnings
Egg whites will not mount properly if they contain particles of egg yolk, or if either bowl or beater is oily or greasy. Any of these elements interfere with the action of the egg whites in forming and sustaining those all-important air bubbles. Before you begin, therefore, wash your equipment with an effcient detergent, and dry it well. Room-temperature egg whites mount more voluminously than chilled egg whites, and chilled egg whites will often form coagulated specks when beaten. Thus either set chilled whole eggs in a bowl of tepid water for 10 minutes before separating them, or let the whites sit 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature before beating.

### Whips and bowls
One of the unexplained mysteries of la cuisine is that the unlined copper bowl used by old French chefs produces splendidly smooth, velvety, and high-rising egg whites that remain stable for a surprisingly long time. Stable means that they do not lose their sheen or get watery a few minutes after you beat them. Fortunately a stainless steel bowl or a plastic bowl used only for egg whites (oil might get into the pores of plastic if you use it for mayonnaise, for instance), plus a pinch of cream of tartar, works very well also. The cream of tartar acts as a stabilizer. Glass and porcelain bowls are not recommended because their slippery sides don’t hold up the whites. You may use a large balloon-shaped wire whip 5 to 6 inches across at its widest diameter, or an electric beater. Here are directions for each.

### How to beat egg whites by hand — for 2 to 8 egg whites
Provide yourself with a clean, dry balloon whip and a clean, dry round-bottomed bowl of unlined copper, stainless steel, or pristine plastic.
The bowl should be 9 to 10 inches in diameter and 5 to 6 inches deep, and the whip 5 to 6 inches in diameter.
To keep the bowl from jumping about, either place it on a wet pot holder or set it in a heavy pot or casserole.
Place the egg whites in the bowl, letting them sit for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature if they have just come from the refrigerator.
Start beating at a speed of 2 strokes per second with a vertical, circular motion for 20 to 30 seconds, until the egg whites have begun to foam.
Then, for 4 egg whites, add a pinch of salt— salt gives a slight ffavor to the egg whites and is added even for sweet souffles.
If you are not using unlined copper, add also a scant 1⁄4 teaspoon of cream of tartar for the 4 egg whites.

Using your lower-arm and wrist muscles for beating—shoulder muscles tire quickly—gradually increase the beating speed to 4 strokes per second, beating as much air as possible into the mixture, and circulating the bowl so all the egg whites are entering into the action.

Start testing as soon as the whites seem to be stiff by gathering a dollop in the wires of the whip and holding it upright. If peaks are formed like those in the illustration, you have achieved “stiffy beaten egg whites.” If not, beat a few seconds more and test again. When you arrive at the right consistency, the egg whites should be folded almost immediately into the souffle mixture.


### How to beat egg whites by machine—for 2 or more egg whites
For the successful beating of egg whites by machine, you must have the kind of equipment that will keep all of the egg whites in motion all of the time. This is best accomplished by the kind of whip mechanism that rotates about itself as well as circulating about the bowl, and that bowl must be of a rather narrow and rounded shape. In other words, you want a machine of the type illustrated on this page. If you have the old-fashioned mixer with a wide ffat-bottomed bowl, substitute a narrower rounded bowl and you will be more successful. Otherwise use a rounded bowl and a hand-held electric beater that you circulate all around the bowl, pretending you are a heavy-duty mixer.

Always start at slow speed for a minute or more, until the egg whites are broken up and begin to foam; gradually increase your speed and when the whites are softly foaming—in about another minute—beat in 1⁄4 teaspoon of cream of tartar and a big pinch of salt (for 4 egg whites). Gradually increase your speed to fast, taking another minute or so. Stand right over your egg whites all the time because it is easy to overbeat them. Stop and check them when the beater begins to leave traces on the surface, and beat to stiff shining peaks as in the previous illustration.

### Egg whites with sugar added  
When the egg whites are to be folded into a cake or sweet souffle batter, you are usually directed to sprinkle in sugar after the whites have formed soft peaks, and you continue to the stiff shining-peak stage. Sugar stabilizes the egg whites and also makes for a stiffer texture.

### Overbeaten egg whites  
You can easily overbeat egg whites in an effcient machine— they lose their velvety shine, turn dull, look grainy and slightly lumpy, and, worse, lose their puffng abilities. You can usually bring them back into shape by beating in another egg white, which will not disturb your recipe proportions.

### Freezing egg whites
Raw egg whites freeze, thaw, and whip up perfectly. Two egg whites make 1⁄4 cup, which you can freeze in custard cups, unmold, and pack in plastic containers for later defrosting.

### Folding in the egg whites
After the main ingredients of the souffle have been blended together and seasoned, the beaten egg whites are incorporated gently and delicately so that they will retain as much of their volume as possible. This process is known as folding, and is accomplished as follows:

[souffle_2.png](souffle_2.png)

First stir a big spoonful of egg whites into the souffle mixture to lighten it. Then with a rubber scraper, scoop the rest of the egg whites on top. Finally, still using your rubber scraper, cut down from the top center of the mixture to the bottom of the saucepan, then draw the scraper quickly toward you against the edge of the pan, and up to the left and out, as illustrated. You are thus bringing a bit of the souffle mixture at the bottom of the pan up over the egg whites. Continue the movement while slowly rotating the saucepan, and rapidly cutting down, toward you, and out to the left, until the egg whites have been folded into the body of the souffle. The whole process should not take more than a minute, and do not attempt to be too thorough. It is better to leave a few unblended patches than to deffate the egg whites.

*AHEAD-OF-TIME NOTES*
After your souffle mold has been fflled and is ready for the oven, you may set it aside in a warm place free from drafts. Cover it with a big empty pot or soup kettle. As long as it is protected, it will not begin to collapse for an hour.

### SOUFFLÉ MOLDS
Although a souffle can be cooked in a fairly shallow porcelain or pyrex dish—the usual type sold in America for this purpose—a more practical one is the cylindrical, metal mold known in France as a charlotte. Charlotte molds come in the following sizes, are inexpensive, and can be ordered from one of the French import shops if you cannot ffnd them elsewhere.

**CHARLOTTE MOLDS**
If you do not have one of these, use a porcelain or pyrex mold holding whatever capacity your recipe speciffes. American recipes for souffles often direct that you use the regular American type of mold and give it added height by tying a double strip of buttered foil or brown paper around the dish and removing it when the souffle is done. We have found this a nuisance, but if you like this method, calculate the capacity of the mold-plus-paper-collar according to the height and diameter measurements in the preceding table.

### Preparing the mold for the souffle
So that the souffle may slide easily up during its rise, butter the sides and bottom of the mold heavily. Then roll grated cheese or bread crumbs around in it, paying particular attention to the inner circumference, which must be lightly but evenly coated. Turn the mold upside down and knock it on the table to dislodge excess cheese or bread crumbs.

*PLACEMENT IN THE OVEN* 
A souffle will always perform as it should if it is placed on a rack in the middle level of a preheated 400-degree oven and the temperature is immediately reduced to 375 degrees.

*GENERAL PROPORTIONS* 
Whether your souffle is made with cheese, ffsh, spinach, or anything else, the proportions with few exceptions remain the same.

*WHEN IS IT DONE?* 
After 25 to 30 minutes of baking in a 375-degree oven, the souffle will have risen 2 or 3 inches over the rim of the mold and will have browned on top. If you like the center creamy, it may be served at this point, but it is fragile and will sink rapidly. It will collapse less readily if you allow it to cook 4 to 5 minutes more, until a trussing needle or thin knife plunged into the center through the side of the puff comes out clean. A well-cooked souffle will stay puffed for about 5 minutes in the turned-off hot oven. As it cools, it begins to sink. Therefore, there should be no lingering when a souffle is to be eaten.

*HOW TO SERVE A SOUFFLÉ*
Puncture the top of the souffle lightly with a serving spoon and fork—held vertically—and spread it apart for each serving.
