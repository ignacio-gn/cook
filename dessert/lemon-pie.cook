Combine @flour{200%g}, @sugar{60%g}, @baking powder{1/2%tsp}, and zest of one fresh @lemon{} in a #bowl. Mix with a fork.

Add @butter{90%g} and form crumbs with the fork.

Add @egg{3%yolks} yolks and mix to form a tender dough.

Beat thoroughly (this is important) and add juice of half a @lemon{}. Continue beating. A soft dough should form. If a soft dough does not form after beating, add a very small amount of lemon juice until a soft dough is achieved.

Approximately 400 g. of dough are obtained. Take out 100 g. to make cookies.

Place in a #24 cm diameter mold{} in a preheated oven at 180Â°C until cooked (~{15%min}) (the edges are golden brown, a toothpick inserted makes a hole). If the dough puffs up, pierce it with a fork it. It will deflate afterwards.

Make the cookies and cook them as well.

While baking, prepare the filling.

Juice lemons and strain until you have 75 cc.

In a small bowl, place @condensed milk{397%g} and pour in the lemon juice while constantly whisking with a fork. It will first look like it isn't working, it will though.

When it thickens, add the zest of all the lemons used for juicing. Mix well.

Place over the hot dough and spread quickly (it starts to solidify).

Refrigerate and decorate with thin slices of lemon when cold OR continue making the meringue

Start making sugar syrup with @sugar{3/4%cup} and only enough @water{3/8%cup} to moisten the sugar and whipping the @egg{3%whites} whites to a stiff consistency (this will take long, even with a hand mixer). Don't mix the sugar in the pan, leave warming up and make sure that it will be done when the meringue has been whipped to a stiff consistency. Both things have to be done simultaneouslt. 

Once the sugar boils, wait for around ~{1%min} and then mix in to the egg whites. If not using sugar syrup, replace with 3 semi-full tablespoons of powdered sugar and a pinch of salt, but keep in mind that this will cause the meringue to only last for around 2 days in the fridge. Keep whipping for a while

Fill a #piping bag{} with the meringue and decorate the top of the pie. Alternatively, smear over the surface and make it uneven with a fork.

Place in the #oven at 150C for to brown. Watch out with the browning of the meringue; as soon as it starts to brown, it will burn very hard, so keen constantly an eye on it. Alternatively, use a blowtorch.
