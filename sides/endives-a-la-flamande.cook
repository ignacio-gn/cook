Preheat the #oven to 165 C.

Trim the base of the @endives{6}. Discard any withered leaves. Wash one by one rapidly under running cold water. Drain.

Smear i / tablespoons butter in the #casserole (2-3 l capacity){}. Lay the endives in it in two layers. Sprinkle each layer with @salt and @lemon juice{/2%tbsp}, and dot with butter. Pour in the @water{1/8%cup}. Cover and boil slowly for io minutes. Uncover and boil rapidly for about ~{10%min} or until liquid is reduced to 1 or 2 tablespoons.

Lay the paper over the endives, cover the casserole, and bake in middle level of preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove casserole cover but leave paper in place, and bake 30 minutes more or until endives are a nice golden yellow. Either arrange the endives in a hot vegetable dish or around your roast, and sprinkle with @parsley{1%tbsp}, or, for a more golden effect, arrange them in a baking dish, baste with melted @butter{1%tbsp}, and brown briefly under the broiler. Sprinkle with parsley just before serving.
