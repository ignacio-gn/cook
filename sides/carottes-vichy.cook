Peel and quarter the @carrots{680%g}. Then cut them <5 cm long.

Boil the carrots slowly in the covered #saucepan (3 l capacity){} with either @brown stock{1.5%cups} or bouillon if making glazed carrots or with @water{1.5%cups} and a pinch of soda if making carottes vichy (the assumption is that pure noncalcareous bottled water produces a more delicate carrot), @sugar{2%tbsp}, @pepper, and @butter{6%tbsp} for 30 to 40 minutes until the carrots are tender and the liquid has reduced to a syrupy glaze. Correct seasoning.

Reheat just before serving and roll the carrots gently in the pan to coat them with syrup. Turn into a hot vegetable dish or arrange them around your roast, and sprinlkle with finely minced @parsley{2%tbsp}.
